<p>In this study we are interested in how people form impressions about others. Here, you will form impressions of people as you play a money sharing game, by learning which people tend to SHARE or NOT SHARE money.</p>

<p>However, before you play this game yourself, you will observe another person playing with the same set of people. This will help you learn about the other players before itâ€™s your turn to play.</p>
