<p>Some players share a point more often than others, but no one shares all the time. The Chooserâ€™s task is to select the player who will share with them.</p>

<p>Your task is to WATCH a Chooser play the game. By LEARNING about which players tend to share, you can win more points (and bonus $) when you play with the players yourself.</p>
