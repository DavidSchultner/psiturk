This is the readme file

This is the Psiturk folder to carry out the Mturk version of Study 4 of the Vici Project. It can be opened using the terminal of linux and MAC machines (there is an experimental approach with windows, unclear if it works).

The experiment is structured as follows:
0. Consent and information (stage 2 of the ad, in psiturk language)
1. Several instructions. 
    1a.Semantic information about Groups A and B (described as favorable or unfavorable depending on condition)
    1b.Information about the scarcity or plentifulness of resources.
    1c.Information about the general outline of the experiment
2. Two blocks of the learning phase, in which participants learn about avatars through repeated interaction. Contains a break. 
    The sharing rates are (70/30, 60/40, 40/60, 30/70).
3. The testphase, in which participants choose between all possible combinations of Group A and B avatars. 
4. Postquestionnaires: demographics, questions about explicit awareness of sharing rates, debriefing.
